#### To attack an account that you do not have permission to might violate your country's laws and wuseman assumes no liability for the use of this tool. If you use the tool then you have accepted this and you are responsible for what the tool is used for, wuseman can NEVER EVER be held responsible..

#### The tool was developed when I lost my password and needed to restore it from command-line with a positive result.

#### README

This is a minimal tool for attack an gmail account without any annoying banners or other useless stuff, this tool does one thing and that is to attack a gmail account as it is supposed to be.

#### HOW TO

    git clone https://github.com/wuseman/WBRUTER-GMAIL
    cd wbruter; ./wbruter gmail

    Thats it, easier than this, it can not be.
    
    Go find a good wordlist or create your own from command-line, a good start would be something like:
    echo {a..z}{0..9}{a..z}{0..9} > passwords
    

#### REQUIREMENTS

A linux setup would be good ;)
