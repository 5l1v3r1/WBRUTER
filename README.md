Everyone that have tried wbruter already knows it is really hard to bruteforce the pin via login screen since after 4 attempts we getting blocked after 4 attempts for X seconds, and after 5 attempts we getting blocked X seconds etc etc, dont worry about this anymore. From now wbruter can guarantee you aslong as USB Debugging is enable you will be able to find the pin no matter how many attempts we need until we will find the pin. This is wbruter version 1.5. You can see my proof that my device is non-rooted and that it actually works no matter how many attempts we are trying:
